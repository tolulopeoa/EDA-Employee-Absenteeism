# Exploratory Data Analysis on Employee Absenteeism

## Business Case Study
>This dataset was put together using absenteeism records from a courier company in Brazil from July 2007 to July 2010.
>
## The Business Task
>In this exercise, I will use exploratory data analysis to determine the likely cause of `Employee Absenteeism` at the company during working hours.
>
## What is Absenteeism?
> `Absenteeism` at work refers to the habitual or intentional absence of an employee from their workplace, where the absence is often unscheduled and unplanned. It is a measure of the frequency and duration of employees being away from work when they are scheduled to be present.
> 
## Purpose of the EDA
>In this exercise, I will analyze patterns of `Absenteeism`, such as the most common reasons for absence, the distribution of absenteeism durations, and any potential correlations with other features in the dataset.
>
>I will explore questions like:
>
>* What are the most common reasons for employee absenteeism?
>* How does the season or month affect absenteeism?
>* Are there patterns in absenteeism based on certain demographics or characteristics?
